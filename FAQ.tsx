      question: "Do I need any marketing experience to use this?",
      answer: "Not at all! Our AI handles all the complex strategy work. You just answer a few simple questions about your book, and we take care of the rest. The plan comes with a step-by-step implementation guide written in plain English."
    },
    {
      question: "How much should I budget for the ads themselves?",
      answer: "We recommend starting with at least $300/month for your ad spend (separate from the subscription cost). Our AI will optimize your budget to maximize ROI, and you can adjust your spend based on performance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this for multiple books?",
      answer: "Each subscription covers one book's marketing plan. If you have multiple books, you can purchase additional plans at a discounted rate."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not happy with the plan?",
      answer: "We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with your marketing plan, just let us know and we'll refund your purchaseâ€”no questions asked."
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from hiring a marketing agency?",
      answer: "Traditional marketing agencies can cost thousands of dollars per month and require long-term contracts. Our AI provides the same strategic value at a fraction of the cost, with no long-term commitment. Plus, you get your plan in minutes, not weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "Will the AI actually run my ads for me?",
      answer: "The AI creates your complete campaign strategy, including ad creatives, targeting, and scheduling. You'll implement the plan through your own Meta Ads account (we provide step-by-step instructions). Our AI then monitors and provides optimization recommendations to improve performance over time."
