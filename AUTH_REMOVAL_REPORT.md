### 3. Unused Files
The following auth-related components still exist but are no longer imported:
- components/LoginModal.tsx
- components/AppDashboard.tsx  
- components/PlanPreviewModal.tsx

These can be safely deleted if needed.

## Current Application Flow

1. **Homepage** → User clicks "Get Started" or "Try Demo"
2. **Dashboard** → Shows 6 tasks with View links
3. **Inner Pages** → Book Brief, Marketing Plan, Organic Posts, Paid Posts

All navigation works without authentication requirements.

## Database Note

The Supabase database still has authentication-ready schemas with RLS policies. These remain in place for future authentication implementation if needed, but are not required for the current application functionality.
